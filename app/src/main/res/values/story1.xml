He suggests that you go to the pier to see if you can find out. </string>

    <string name="int12_option2"> Paddle to the nearby island.</string>
    <string name="int12_option3"></string>
    <string name="int13_main_text">You wish that the boat you took was in better conditions. Especially when you get out a few miles and your boat breaks. Thankfully, you notice an island not too far from where you are.</string>

    <string name="int15_option1">Go Left.</string>
    <string name="int15_option2">Go right.</string>
    <string name="int15_option3">Go straight.</string>
    <string name="int16_main_text">That seems to be the right direction. At least it did until everything around you seemed to start growing. You realize that you are falling through a sinkhole. The more you try to get out the farther you fall. This is the end. But it wasn\'t. You have entered an entirely new world. You are startled by a voice coming from behind you. He informs you that he is your dux ducis (whatever that means) and he has been sent to help you save the world. He provides a hint to help you with your mission. Resist temptation, whatever that means. Just then, you see a young boy in the distance. </string>
    <string name="int16_option1">Approach the boy.</string>
    <string name="int16_option2">Spy on the boy.</string>
    <string name="int16_option3">Walk around the boy.</string>
    <string name="int17_main_text">When you approach the boy he gives you a riddle. I am a number with a couple of friends, quarter a dozen, and you\'ll find me again. What am I? You answer...</string>
    <string name="int17_option1">three.</string>
    <string name="int17_option2">four.</string>
    <string name="int17_option3">twenty-five.</string>
    <string name="int18_main_text">You decide to climb a tall tree to get a better visual of the boy. You realize that he is whittling some bark. You decide to get a little closer and you realize that the image he is carving looks very similar to the map on your computer. </string>
    <string name="int18_option1">Steal the bark from the boy. </string>
    <string name="int18_option2">Talk to the boy.</string>
    <string name="int18_option3">Go around the boy.</string>
    <string name="int19_main_text">After going around the boy, you realize that you are completely lost. You wish you had more direction, but at this point all hope is lost. </string>
    <string name="int19_option1">YOU GOT THE LOST IN THE FOREST ENDING. </string>
    <string name="int19_option2"></string>
    <string name="int19_option3"></string>
    <string name="int20_main_text">You must be quite the mastermind, because you solved the riddle! The boy was pleased with your answer and decided to give you the piece of bark he was carving. You match the drawing to your map and realize that it has additional paths on it. </string>
    <string name="int20_option1">Follow the new path. </string>
    <string name="int20_option2">Ask the boy to come on your journey with you. </string>
    <string name="int20_option3"> Continue on the old path. </string>
    <string name="int21_main_text">You failed to figure out the riddle. Lucky for you, the boy decides to give you one more shot. An apple is 40 cents, a banana is 60 cents and a grapefruit is 80 cents. How much is a pear? You answer...</string>
    <string name="int21_option1">40 cents. </string>
    <string name="int21_option2">1 dollar.</string>
    <string name="int21_option3">20 cents.</string>
    <string name="int22_main_text">You decide to steal the bark from the boy. It is after all the fastest way to continue on your journey. And you are completely justified because you are trying to save the world. Right?</string>
    <string name="int22_option1">Absolutely. No regrets. </string>
    <string name="int22_option2">It\'s fine, but I might feel bad about it later. </string>
    <string name="int22_option3">I just broke every moral bone in my body. </string>
    <string name="int23_main_text">This piece of bark is definitely the next piece of the puzzle. You decide to follow its clues. It takes you to the edge of a forest. The map leads you around the forest, but you see that there is a shortcut through the woods. </string>
    <string name="int23_option1">Trust in the map.</string>
    <string name="int23_option2">Take the shortcut.</string>
    <string name="int23_option3">Take a break.</string>
    <string name="int24_main_text">The boy is surprised by your offer! Nobody has ever invited him to be apart of the action before. He graciously accepts and you realize that he is actually quite helpful. As you follow the new map, you are lead to a forest. The map wants you to go around the forest, but there is a clear shortcut through. </string>
    <string name="int24_option1">Trust in the map. </string>
    <string name="int24_option2">Take the shortcut. </string>
    <string name="int24_option3">Take a break.</string>
    <string name="int25_main_text">As you continue on your previous pathway, you hear a voice from behind you. It is dux ducis, your guide. He asks you why you haven\'t been following the clues he has left you. He thinks you may not have been the right person for the job. </string>
    <string name="int25_option1">Convince him you are the right person.</string>
    <string name="int25_option2">Start on the new path right away.</string>
    <string name="int25_option3"></string>
    <string name="int26_main_text">Phew! You figured that one out. I was a little bit worried for a minute. The boy accepts your answer and decided to give you the piece of bark he was carving. You match the drawing to your map and realize that it has additional paths on it.  </string>
    <string name="int26_option1">Follow the new path. </string>
    <string name="int26_option2">Ask the boy to come on your journey with you. </string>
    <string name="int26_option3">Continue on the old path.</string>
    <string name="int27_main_text">Oops! Wrong again. You fell through a trap door and died. </string>
    <string name="int27_option1">You Died.</string>
    <string name="int27_option2"></string>
    <string name="int27_option3"></string>
    <string name="int28_main_text">Well aren\'t you quite the criminal....After running away from the boy, you match the drawing to your map and realize that it has additional paths on it. </string>
    <string name="int28_option1">Follow the new path.</string>
    <string name="int28_option2">Continue on the old path. </string>
    <string name="int28_option3"> Take a break.</string>
    <string name="int29_main_text">You feel a little bit bad about stealing the bark from the boy, but you believe that you made the right choice. It is better to ask forgiveness later than waste time asking permission first, right?  You match the drawing to your map and realize that it has additional paths on it. </string>
    <string name="int29_option1"> Follow the new path. </string>
    <string name="int29_option2">Continue on the old path.</string>
    <string name="int29_option3">Take a break.</string>
    <string name="int30_main_text">Stealing was definitely the wrong option!! What are you going to do!!! You have never been the criminal type!!! You rush back to the boy and give him his bark back. You apologize and explain why you stole from him in the first place. He is very interested in your situation and offers you the drawing. You thank him and graciously accept. When you take a closer look at the map you match the drawing to your map and realize that it has additional paths on it. </string>
    <string name="int30_option1">Follow the new path. </string>
    <string name="int30_option2">Ask the boy to come on your journey with you. </string>
    <string name="int30_option3">Continue on the old path. </string>
    <string name="int31_main_text">You decide to trust in the map. It probably knows much more than you do anyway. You make it around the forest faster than you thought you would and you arrive at a crossroad. </string>

    <string name="int31_option2">Take the path on the left. </string>

    <string name="int32_option1"> Pick up the drumsticks.</string>
    <string name="int32_option2"> Run out of the forest as fast as you can.  </string>
    <string name="int32_option3">Take your time exploring the forest. </string>
