    <string name="mus2_main_text">During your Band class the Band teacher hands out a new piece of music called “Undertow”. You start to notice something different when reading the music, it almost seems like the notes are forming a pathway. The title seems to be turning into a red X. You close your eyes and think that you are seeing things, however when you open them the music has turned into a treasure map of some type. It fascinates you and you stare deeply into every detail of it. You could have sworn it was a music sheet just a second before. You ask to go to the bathroom and bring the map with you. Along the way you run into the creepy Janitor, “Steve”, you both hit the floor hard and the map flies out of your hand. Steve grabs it and gives it back to you, all the while yelling at you for being stupid and blind. He glances at it while giving it back. You run away from Steve scared for your life. As you reach the bathroom you stop and decide to just go for it. You bust open the door next to the bathroom and head outside.</string>
